[Question]:
> Hi all,
>
Has anyone got a 205si or an N3 306 (pref 2dr) they want to move on?
>
Looking for something that is on (or without too much hassle, could be put on) the road, but with a view to being used for entry level motorsport.
>
Prefer Victoria, but SA, NSW, ACT could be doable.

Over the years, I've lost one 306 to a flood, one to an uninsured maniac and one to a breakup - hopefully that's the run of 3 done and now I can find one to hang on to!
