### Another 205 Si joins the fleet

>I have a 205 Si available, was my everyday driver, ex Mike Jolley. I gave it to my daughter Kathryn to use as a paddock car after its auto developed problems changing into 4th. This is being replaced with a 405 so thinking the 205 should be used for someone's project. Only want a couple of hundred, body is sound with no rust, no sunroof, Topaz Blue. Needs an auto obviously but could supply that, engine has had a new head gasket and timing belt but has a problem, leaning towards needing a MAP sensor at the moment, should be able to fix this if you want to use the engine. Would come with new 13 inch Michelins wear wise but a few years old. Good points are the low km Xsara front struts and base model 206 front brakes, also new alternator. Great basis for a competition car project.[^1]

Passed on to me minus the motor, transmission, steering rack, one of the headlights and both front seats, but plus 14" wheels and tyres, parts for rear discs and a few other bits and pieces.
