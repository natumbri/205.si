I envy those with a 205 AND a 306.[^1]   If one particular car was clearly better, we'd all be driving the same freaking thing.[^4]

> Hey guys, looking at selling my 306 S16.
I’ve owned it for around 5 years, the previous owner had it parked up for around 6 years due to the heater matrix leaking.
On purchasing I replaced the matrix, timing belt, water pump, radiator, bottom hose, ignition coils, spark plugs, battery and all fluids. I then used it as my daily driver for around a year before purchasing a van to help move house and it’s been parked in my carport ever since. 
I’ve started it on a regular basis and it starts and drives around my driveway perfectly fine but, would probably recommend fuel flush for any long drive, all tyres hold air and the battery is 6 months old.
known issues are the front sway bar bushes are perished and will require replacement. I think there maybe a pin hole somewhere in the exhaust system I’ll check and confirm that, the battery terminals are pretty average, the battery light glows dimly on the dash but the alternator is charging it’s been like this since I bought it and never failed on me possibly due to the battery terminals? the body has plenty of clear coat peeling. Not really sure what these are selling for I’ll put $2500 and we can go from there. Thanks located in Adelaide[^5]

Decided I need a car for getting around, including for getting to the 205 to work on it, so ordered a 306 S16.

###Which is better? A 205 or a 306?[^2]
205 | 306
--|--
feels more like a race car | more powerful
more involving drive with the potential to offer greater driver involvment |  better appointed, built better and just classier all around
205 will take at least twice the maintenance of the 306, but has the potential to supply twice the fun factor | I wouldn't buy a car these days without airbags or ABS
The 205 is less complex, less likely to fail than an old model 306, slightly easier to work on / maintain, will be easier and cheaper to find parts for blah blah. | I would have thought it would a lot easier to find parts for the 306, heaps more sold.
driving a [205] is a back to basics-everything rattles banger if ever there was one. | the s16 is A LOT more forgiving if you don't get it right, whereas the 205 punishes you for not getting it right.
