Is there a proper way to get the hubs to let go of the struts?    

> a little bit of WD40 around where the hub clamps the strut (dont know if its necessary but cant hurt) then undo the bolt and then just carefully tap a cold chisel into the split
no need to whack it or anything, just enough to unclamp and the strut slips out especially in australia where there's rarely ever any corrosion.[^1] The manual sez to insert an Allen key in the split on the flats and then twist on the apex to spread the split. It works, but you need something to keep the Allen on the apex.[^2]

That is _not_ what happened for me. Lots of difficulty separating the hubs from the struts.

###Is there anything I should be looking to replace or refurbish?

>Get some strut top bearings, yours will probably be working ok but they get a bit gummed up after 25 years.  You can get a kit with the rubbers and bearings but your rubbers will be fine. If you replace the strut top bearings yourself just make sure you have a nice set of spring compressors or you can take them into a tyre shop which is way easier and less scary.

####Hubs

>If your ball joints were shot you'd already know, same for wheel bearings so no worries there. Check your disk pads have plenty left and change if not; the book has minimums for the disc rotors (at the beginning of the brake chapter) - check with a set of calipers and get a new SET if needed.   

####Subframe
