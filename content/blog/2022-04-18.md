A broken chassis where the upper engine mount bolts on wasn't on the list. Is now. I wonder how hard that's going to be to fix... [^1]  

And it is supposed to have a new heater core. So I wonder why the heater isn't hot?[^2]   

Those are the big ticket items, so far.   

Probably needs new front seats and an alternator, too. Plus a set of bushes and the usual consumables.
