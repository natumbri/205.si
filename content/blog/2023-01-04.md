The goal for today is to remove the front subframe, without breaking anything (or anyone)


####Step 1 - round off the brake line nuts

Getting the brake lines undone was a real pain.  Tried normal spanner. Nope.  Went to [generic car bits shop], purchase brake line spanners.  Nope.  (Return crap brake line spanners.)

Looking pretty round and shiny there.  There is, of course, one sure way to get it done...

Brake line removed (and a little bit wrecked).


####Step 2 - undo the hub nuts
Big socket, big breaker bar, big jumping on the end of it.

####Step 3 - undo the lower control arms at the hub
Easy.

####Step 4 - disconnect the steering rack from the hubs
Done.

####Step 5 - undo the struts and remove them
No dramas.

####Step 6 - unbolt the steering rack from the subframe, tie it up.
Check.  While you're there, disconnect the gear change linkages and unclip the clutch cable.

####Step 7 - remove drive shafts.
Don't forget to piss gearbox oil everywhere.  Don't forget to release the bearing for the long drive shaft. If the boots are wrecked, you might accidentally disassemble one of the joints.

... and drop needle rollers everywhere ...

... so you have to pick them all up ...

33 per bearing, 3 bearings per side.

####Remove subframe
Undo the bolts (4 at the back, 2 at the front)
Lower it down with a jack

Anyone need a 205 Si subframe?

###Close of play

Dissassembled.  Need to get the driveshafts put back together, which is a pain, but they were getting new boots anyway, so oh well.
