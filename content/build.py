    Project Overview
Iâ€™m restoring and modifying three Peugeot 205 Si 
models, each with a different focus. This page 
introduces the three projects, with links to 
detailed build plans and updates. ---

    Restoration Plan
## Project Goals
- Swap the complete XU7 engine and ZF 4HP14 
automatic gearbox from a donor Peugeot 306 - Retain 
the original Magneti Marelli monopoint G5/G6 EFI 
system for smooth, reliable running - Upgrade front 
brakes using Peugeot 306 ventilated discs, calipers, 
and 14" wheels for improved safety and performance - 
Maintain the car as a comfortable and dependable 
automatic runabout ---
## Two-Stage Work Schedule & Checklist with Time 
## Estimates
### Stage One: Donor 306 Strip & Prep
- [ ] Prepare clean workspace for donor vehicle

oil, coolant, transmission fluid) â€” **0.5 hr** - [ ] 
Disconnect wiring, hoses, and label carefully â€” 
**2.0 hrs** - [ ] Remove wheels, brakes, and 
suspension components, retaining needed parts â€” 
**2.0 hrs** - [ ] Remove complete XU7 engine and ZF 
4HP14 transmission assembly â€” **3.0 hrs** - [ ] 
Separate engine and gearbox if needed for 
refurbishment â€” **1.0 hr** - [ ] Transfer 205 
monopoint intake manifold and sensors onto XU7 
engine â€” **1.5 hrs** - [ ] Inspect and refurbish 
engine components (timing belt, water pump, seals) â€” 
**6.0 hrs** - [ ] Inspect and refurbish transmission 
(fluid change, filter, seals) â€” **3.0 hrs** - [ ] 
Inspect, clean, and refurbish 306 brake calipers and 
ventilated discs â€” **3.0 hrs** - [ ] Inspect hubs, 
bearings, and replace brake hoses/adapters as 
necessary â€” **2.0 hrs** - [ ] Organize, label, and 
store all parts carefully â€” **1.0 hr** - [ ] Dispose 
or recycle non-useful donor parts â€” **0.5 hr** - [ ] 
Order any missing components and tools â€” **0.5 hr** 
**Stage One Total Estimate: ~26.5 hours** ---
### Stage Two: 205 Prep & Swap
- [ ] Prepare workspace for 205 teardown â€” **1.0 
hr** - [ ] Drain fluids from 205 (engine oil, 
coolant, brake fluid) â€” **0.5 hr** - [ ] Remove 
original engine and transmission from 205 â€” **3.0 
hrs** - [ ] Inspect 205 front hubs and uprights 
(bearings, seals) â€” **1.5 hrs** - [ ] Install 
prepped donor XU7 engine and ZF 4HP14 transmission 
using 205 mounts â€” **4.0 hrs** - [ ] Connect 205 
monopoint wiring loom and ECU to swapped engine â€” 
**2.0 hrs** - [ ] Install 306 ventilated front discs 
and calipers on 205 hubs â€” **2.5 hrs** - [ ] Fit 306 
14" wheels with correct tyres for clearance and 
diameter â€” **1.0 hr** - [ ] âœ… Master cylinder 
already upgraded â€” no action needed - [ ] Fill all 
fluids and bleed brakes thoroughly â€” **1.5 hrs** - [ 
] Conduct electrical and mechanical system checks â€” 
**1.5 hrs** - [ ] Perform initial road test and 
monitor for issues â€” **1.0 hr** - [ ] Adjust 
throttle cable, gear selector, and brakes as needed 
â€” **1.5 hrs** - [ ] Schedule routine post-swap 
maintenance â€” **0.5 hr** **Stage Two Total Estimate: 
~24.5 hours** ---
## Scheduling Tips
- **Evenings (Weekdays):** Use 1â€“3 hour windows for 
draining fluids, cleaning parts, organizing tools, 
and wiring tasks - **Weekends:** Allocate longer 4â€“6 
hour sessions for engine/trans removal, suspension, 
brake, and install work - **Prep Ahead:** Order 
parts and prep tools during the week to maximize 
weekend productivity - **Break Up Large Tasks:** 
Spread engine removal or install over multiple 
sessions if needed - **Log Progress:** Use blog 
posts to track sessions, issues, or part notes â€” it 
keeps momentum going - **Be Flexible:** Build in 
extra time for stuck bolts, missing tools, or 
problem-solving ---
