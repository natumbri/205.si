### Camshaft changes
> You camshaft choice is limited by two factors:
> 1. Material Available - A DFZ cam can only be ground to approx. 237º @ 0.050" and 0.425" max lift, otherwise the shims become excessively thick. The DKZ cam has a bigger lobe on the inlet, so you have more freedom there. However, the exhaust lobe is the same as the DFZ, thus the same applies. You could have a "dual pattern" grind, where the inlet and exhaust differ, but you'll pay for two setups. This is the best solution for a DKZ cam, otherwise you're grinding away valuable lift on the inlet. Thus you could have approx. 240º @ 0.050" and up to 0.450" lift on the inlet. Or more duration and similar lift. eg 248º @ 0.050" and 0.425" lift.   
> 2. ECU/Manifold - the standard inlet isn't so much the restriction, but the AFM and thus the ECU. Changing to an aftermarket ECU and mapping fuel via TPS, allows you to remove the AFM. Reversion pulses from more camshaft overlap upset the AFM. You can run the standard inlet with the PTS7048 max torque cam for example, which has 295º advertised duration and 251º @ 0.050". If you have 11:1, this would be suitable. If in Qld, talk to Tighe. If in Melbourne talk to Crow.   
>   
> Make sure you set the valve seat spring pressures correctly, regardless. If you do choose an aftermarket cam from Catcams etc., make sure you check for spring bind if lift is more than 0.460" You may need double springs.   
> You'll need a vernier pulley regardless of cam choice, unless you're handy with a lathe.[^1]
