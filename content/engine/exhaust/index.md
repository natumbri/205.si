>Exhaust is after market. Pipes look too small. They always use a size smaller when building up a replacement system.   

The xu5 benefits from a larger less restrictive exhaust the standard item is puny maybe 2inch.[^3]

The exhaust is very simple on a 205, with just a few bits of straight pipe. My preference is 2.25" from the downpipe back, 12" torpedo type resonator in the middle, and a centre offset muffler at the rear. If still too loud, or you want ultimate sleeper look, change the tailpipe to 2". I've done straight through on the rear muffler as well, but it's a tad noisy if the muffler isn't big enough.[^1] If you want the best, you'd fit a 2.25" cat as well.[^2]
