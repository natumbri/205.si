check your speakers. shagged by age: intact but the paper cones were all disintegrated around the outer edge.[^3]


if you want to change the radio, go for an OEM Honda out of early 2000 cars (doesn't matter which, they're all the same as long as they are single DIN). I would go for a full logic control but that's just me. Those are well made high quality radios. If you can get the speakers with the head unit, even better. You can get a unit with cassette or with CD, whatever blows your budget (expect to pay zip to 20 bucks). Don't be daft and go for aftermarket. Aftermarket will never beat OEM quality of a serious manufacturer who employs specialist engineers to spend time and money to make sure they get it right. Some had codes some didn't (it was up to the buyer to request the code be eliminated when purchasing the car new). Make sure you get the code if it has one and test it. Honda can sometimes help if you have the radio numbers or the car's VIN.[^3]
