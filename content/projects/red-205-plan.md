## Scheduling Tips

- **Evenings (Weekdays):** Use 1–3 hour windows for draining fluids, cleaning parts, organizing tools, and wiring tasks  
- **Weekends:** Allocate longer 4–6 hour sessions for engine/trans removal, suspension, brake, and install work  
- **Prep Ahead:** Order parts and prep tools during the week to maximize weekend productivity  
- **Break Up Large Tasks:** Spread engine removal or install over multiple sessions if needed  
- **Log Progress:** Use blog posts to track sessions, issues, or part notes — it keeps momentum going  
- **Be Flexible:** Build in extra time for stuck bolts, missing tools, or problem-solving
