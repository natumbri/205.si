### Si to GTi Conversion

GTi and Si brake line brackets are identical but are in different locations.  To convert Si to GTi suspension, it is necessary to drill out the spot welds on the old ones until they come off, relocate them and braze/weld them onto their new location, clear of the struts/droplinks. The solid brake lines need to be replaced and the flexible brake hoses also need to be replaced; GTi hoses are longer (435mm), with a rubber grommet half way along which slots into the strut bracket for support.[^3]
