The 4-speed automatic transmission ZF 4HP14 found application on compact cars produced by Peugeot and Citroën, later it was installed on Daewoo models. This successful transmission also operated and on Volvo and Saab cars with engine capacity up to 2 liters. The main improvements in this transmission were implemented in 1986, and in 1989. Since then, the 4HP14 design hasn’t been seriously changed.[^4]

The main maintenance requirement for this transmission during many years of reliable service is timely ATF change (Dexron III or Dexron VI) and fiilter replacement every 100 thousand kilometers. The torque converter unit of this transmission easily operates for 200 thousand kilometers without any repair. There is no much information related to the repair of hard parts of the ZF 4HP14 ... because this transmission operates properly for a long time and the car gets too old before the first transmission overhaul.[^5]

The ZF4HP14 was the workhorse transmission of its time. It came from an era when ZF made good transmissions and it was the go to transmission for many small to medium cars. Tough, reliable and everlasting. An oil change every 80kkm and they just keep going. Its a pretty simple install as it doesn't require electronic trickery, its module is stand alone and simple, and again reliable. Down side is its an older design from the early 80's. Its slower to change and react than the current generation of autos and is less happy to be used manually, but still can be if needed. No funky sports or snow modes, that you may not need anyway.[^1]

You will like the auto, they outrun a manual car to about 100 Km/h[^2]

There is a 205 Si auto amongst the growing band of motorsport Sis in the PCCV. It seemed to go well in the dirt motorkhana at Ballarat a week ago. Actually got quickest time in the first test.[^3]
