Two lumps of metal and some springs. Even if they were a good idea in general they would be a bad idea in a BE box due to the weakness of the pin holding the standard diff together. Removing that weakness is a big secondary benefit to fitting an LSD to a BE box so an LSD that retains it probably wont last long under the extra stress.[^2]

#### 'Plate'-type differential 


#### Lada Samara
A plate LSD from Lada Samara fits in be3 gearbox.[^1] There are couple of more issues, including the absence of a speedo drive. 
- Splines match. 
- Diff bearing inner diameter is 35mm (Lada Samara) vs 38 mm (BE3).  This can be fixed by having couple of bushings made with an inner diameter a fraction under 35 mm, heated and then installed. 
- It is also necessary to use a use thick washer under right side diff bearing.  
- Final drive and diff must be machined to center the final drive and to bring it to the right position; new holes must be drilled into FD.

##### Samara v BE3
